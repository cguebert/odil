Welcome to Odil's documentation!
================================

Odil is a C++11 library for the `DICOM <http://dicom.nema.org/>`_ standard.

Odil leverages C++ constructs to provide a user-friendly API of the different
parts of the `DICOM <http://dicom.nema.org/>`_ standard. Included in Odil are
exception-based error handling, generic access to datasets elements, standard 
JSON and XML representation of datasets, and generic implementation of 
messages, clients and servers for the various DICOM protocols.

Odil also provides conversion to and from 
`DCMTK <http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en>`_ data structures.

Odil builds and run on:

* Linux (Debian 7, Debian 8, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, both 32 and 64 bits)
* OS X
